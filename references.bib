  abstract  = {Deep learning is the state-of-the-art machine learning approach. The success of deep learning in many pattern recognition applications has brought excitement and high expectations that deep learning, or artificial intelligence (AI), can bring revolutionary changes in health care. Early studies of deep learning applied to lesion detection or classification have reported superior performance compared to those by conventional techniques or even better than radiologists in some tasks. The potential of applying deep-learning-based medical image analysis to computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), thus providing decision support to clinicians and improving the accuracy and efficiency of various diagnostic and treatment processes, has spurred new research and development efforts in CAD. Despite the optimism in this new era of machine learning, the development and implementation of CAD or AI tools in clinical practice face many challenges. In this chapter, we will discuss some of these issues and efforts needed to develop robust deep-learning-based CAD tools and integrate these tools into the clinical workflow, thereby advancing towards the goal of providing reliable intelligent aids for patient care.},

  abstract = {The performance of six existing deep learning architectures were compared for the task of detection of mango fruit in images of tree canopies. Images of trees (n = 1 515) from across five orchards were acquired at night using a 5 Mega-pixel RGB digital camera and 720 W of LED flood lighting in a rig mounted on a farm utility vehicle operating at 6 km/h. The two stage deep learning architectures of Faster R-CNN(VGG) and Faster R-CNN(ZF), and the single stage techniques YOLOv3, YOLOv2, YOLOv2(tiny) and SSD were trained both with original resolution and 512 × 512 pixel versions of 1 300 training tiles, while YOLOv3 was run only with 512 × 512 pixel images, giving a total of eleven models. A new architecture was also developed, based on features of YOLOv3 and YOLOv2(tiny), on the design criteria of accuracy and speed for the current application. This architecture, termed 'MangoYOLO', was trained using: (i) the 1 300 tile training set, (ii) the COCO dataset before training on the mango training set, and (iii) a daytime image training set of a previous publication, to create the MangoYOLO models 's', 'pt' and 'bu', respectively. Average Precision plateaued with use of around 400 training tiles. MangoYOLO(pt) achieved a F1 score of 0.968 and Average Precision of 0.983 on a test set independent of the training set, outperforming other algorithms, with a detection speed of 8 ms per 512 × 512 pixel image tile while using just 833 Mb GPU memory per image (on a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 Ti GPU) used for in-field application. The MangoYOLO model also outperformed other models in processing of full images, requiring just 70 ms per image (2 048 × 2 048 pixels) (i.e., capable of processing ~ 14 fps) with use of 4 417 Mb of GPU memory. The model was robust in use with images of other orchards, cultivars and lighting conditions. MangoYOLO(bu) achieved a F1 score of 0.89 on a day-time mango image dataset. With use of a correction factor estimated from the ratio of human count of fruit in images of the two sides of sample trees per orchard and a hand harvest count of all fruit on those trees, MangoYOLO(pt) achieved orchard fruit load estimates of between 4.6 and 15.2% of packhouse fruit counts for the five orchards considered. The labelled images (1 300 training, 130 validation and 300 test) of this study are available for comparative studies.}

  abstract       = {In recent years, deep learning has garnered tremendous success in a variety of application domains. This new field of machine learning has been growing rapidly and has been applied to most traditional application domains, as well as some new areas that present more opportunities. Different methods have been proposed based on different categories of learning, including supervised, semi-supervised, and un-supervised learning. Experimental results show state-of-the-art performance using deep learning when compared to traditional machine learning approaches in the fields of image processing, computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, art, medical imaging, medical information processing, robotics and control, bioinformatics, natural language processing, cybersecurity, and many others. This survey presents a brief survey on the advances that have occurred in the area of Deep Learning (DL), starting with the Deep Neural Network (DNN). The survey goes on to cover Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Auto-Encoder (AE), Deep Belief Network (DBN), Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Additionally, we have discussed recent developments, such as advanced variant DL techniques based on these DL approaches. This work considers most of the papers published after 2012 from when the history of deep learning began. Furthermore, DL approaches that have been explored and evaluated in different application domains are also included in this survey. We also included recently developed frameworks, SDKs, and benchmark datasets that are used for implementing and evaluating deep learning approaches. There are some surveys that have been published on DL using neural networks and a survey on Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, those papers have not discussed individual advanced techniques for training large-scale deep learning models and the recently developed method of generative models.},

  abstract = {Deep learning constitutes a recent, modern technique for image processing and data analysis, with promising results and large potential. As deep learning has been successfully applied in various domains, it has recently entered also the domain of agriculture. In this paper, we perform a survey of 40 research efforts that employ deep learning techniques, applied to various agricultural and food production challenges. We examine the particular agricultural problems under study, the specific models and frameworks employed, the sources, nature and pre-processing of data used, and the overall performance achieved according to the metrics used at each work under study. Moreover, we study comparisons of deep learning with other existing popular techniques, in respect to differences in classification or regression performance. Our findings indicate that deep learning provides high accuracy, outperforming existing commonly used image processing techniques.}
