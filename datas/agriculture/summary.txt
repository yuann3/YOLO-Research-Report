Fruit Ripeness Classification Performance
- Precision: 0.9990
- Recall: 0.9997
- F1 Score: 0.9993
- mAP50: 0.9950
- Processing Time: ~5-7 ms per image (with GPU)


Key Findings
- YOLO models achieve real-time processing speeds for fruit ripeness classification
- The R-LBP preprocessing technique significantly improves detection accuracy by enhancing texture features
- The model effectively distinguishes between fresh and rotten fruits across different types (apples, bananas, oranges)
- This approach is feasible for real-world agricultural applications for automated quality control
- The trained model is lightweight enough for deployment on edge devices for in-field use
